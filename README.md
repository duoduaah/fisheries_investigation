# Fisheries_investigation: project to predict the salinity of the ocean given certain attributes.


Dataset https://www.kaggle.com/sohier/calco� The California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI) data set represents the longest (1949-present) and most complete (more than 50,000 sampling stations) time series of oceanographic and larval �sh data in the world. The �le contains data collected at depths down to 500m which include: temperature, salinity, oxygen, phosphate, silicate, nitrate and nitrite, chlorophyll, transmissometer, PAR, C14 primary productivity, phytoplankton biodiversity, zooplankton biomass, and zooplankton biodiversity.The objective of the task is to predict salinity.

Tasks done in the jupyter notebook:
1. Data Cleaning.
2. Determining correlation of features with salinity (target variable).
3. Checking multicollinearity using Variance Inflation Factor (VIF).
4. ML models: LinearRegressor, GradientBoostingRegressor, ADABoostRegressor, RandomForestRegressor to predict salinity.
